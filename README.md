# Introduction 
Respresso is a centralized resource manager for shared Android and iOS projects.
It allows you to simply import the latest assets into your workspace.
You may store several versions of the same resource in the cloud and pick the ones you need to import.
Respresso currently supports five types of resources:
* Images
* App icons
* Localization
* Fonts
* Colors

# Usage
The plugin aar needs to be defined in the classpath of your build script. It is directly available on Maven central. This snippet shows how to add repositories to your root build.gradle:
```groovy
buildscript {
    
    dependencies {
        classpath "hu.ponte.respresso:client-android:0.0.2"
    }
}
```

To use the Respresso Android plugin, include this snippet in your app's build.gradle (app/build.gradle):
```groovy
apply plugin: "hu.ponte.respresso"

respresso {
    projectToken "YOUR_PROJECT_TOKEN_HERE"
    resources {
        require "localization:1.0.0"
        require "color:1.0.0"
        require "appIcon:1.0.0"
        require "image:1.0.0"
        require "font:1.0.0"
    }

    server "https://app.respresso.io"
}
```
Please note that you must remove or comment out unused resources types.
Now you can build your project and Respresso will import all resources that were stored at https://app.respresso.io previously. After the first successful build Respresso will create a "respressofile.lock" file on your project's root directory. This file contains information about current assetsâ€™ metadata.

### Automatic usage
Simply press the Run button for your "app". Respresso will synchronize all resources before builds since its plugin is built into your build flow.

### Manual usage
To synchronize resources without building, use gradle. Use the GUI "Tasks/other/getRespressoResForDebug"   

![Respresso synchronize GUI](/images/respresso-gradle.png)  

or use terminal and type:
Windows: 
```
gradlew getRespressoResForDebug
```

Linux: 
```
./gradlew getRespressoResForDebug
```

Mac: 
```
./gradlew getRespressoResForDebug
```

Note! Respresso will remove all resources that do not belong to it. If you would like to use unfollowed or client-specific resources, read the Tips section.

## Breakdown of the plugin configuration
* Include the project token received during initialization of your project in the Respresso web interface. This is done in the same manner as the host with the keyword "project_token" and your token inside double quotation marks
* Specify the required resources inside the resources section using the following format:
require "[resource_name]:[version_number]"

The currently accepted resource names are:
* image
* appIcon
* color
* localization
* font
        
Accepted version formats are:
* [major].[minor].[patch]          eg. 1.2.0
* [major].[minor].[patch]+         eg. 1.2.0+ (not available in strict mode)
* [major].[minor]+                 eg. 1.2+ (not available in strict mode)


### Optional arguments
###### server
Specify the server of your assets in the last line by writing "server" and your URL in double quotation marks separated by a space.
By omitting this argument Respresso will use its default host URL for syncing.
```
server "https://app.respresso.io"
```

###### strictMode
Enabling strict mode will guarantee you get the same results each time you sync your assets. If set to true, you may only specify exact version numbers in your Respressofile. This option is set to false by default. Usage example:  
```
strictMode true
```

## Tips
##### Android Studio is unable to find a resource
Android Studio may sometimes ignore new resource files. If this is the case, use the "File/Invalidate caches / Restart..." option.

##### Use your own resources
You can create a new module for Respresso. Respresso will synchronize all followed resources into the "module's res" folder in this case and your main module can contain unique resources.
